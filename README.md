# 4inch SD Card Camera

Hello this is a camera project based on Arduino and PlatformIO. I have already compiled the corresponding code. First, I ran my code on a breadboard using jumper wires. Then, I designed a PCB for it. However, I donâ€™t have soldering tools at the moment, so the PCB is currently unassembled. That said, both the code and PCB design are working fine, so I believe I will be able to complete it soon.
