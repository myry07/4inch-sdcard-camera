# 4inch SD Card Camera

Hello this is a camera project based on Arduino and PlatformIO. I have already compiled the corresponding code. First, I ran my code on a breadboard using jumper wires. Then, I designed a PCB for it. However, I don’t have soldering tools at the moment, so the PCB is currently unassembled. That said, both the code and PCB design are working fine, so I believe I will be able to complete it soon.

When you connect the power, this is the interface you will see.

I used the LVGL framework to make this project cooler and add more features. This is a camera project—when you press the on-screen button or the onboard boot button, the photo will be saved to the SD card. You can also swipe to navigate and adjust the onboard WS LED.
